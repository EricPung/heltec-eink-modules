# Heltec EInk Modules

Arduino Graphics library for the Heltec E-Ink "Modules"

~~Under active development - arriving soon~~ 

**Heltec have released code allowing for a high-speed partial update on their V2 Displays**
This driver *will* be completed, as I will need to use it for my own projects, however there could be some delay.

In the meantime, have a look around https://heltec.org/project/154-e-ink/ if you are stuck.
