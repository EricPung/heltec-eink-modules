Historically, this library seperated fullscreen and windowed routines, as seen here. For most displays, the two have been unified.

This display ( ```QYEG0213RWS8000``` ) has a quirky resolution. The fullscreen region does not fit nicely into a window.

As a result, there are two seperate code-sets for handling windowed and fullscreen operation.

*This may eventually be fixed in a non-breaking update.*
