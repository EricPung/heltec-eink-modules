# Transitioning to V2
Version 2 is in active development. This is a list of prospective *breaking changes* between V1.x and V2

* Rename display classes
* Seperate Fast-Mode (partial update) methods
* Seperate window / fullscreen methods
* Remove user specified wake & sleep callbacks
* Remove non-blocking update routine

Some of the removed functionality may eventually be reintroduced.
